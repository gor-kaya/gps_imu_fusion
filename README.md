# gps_imu_fusion
This is a repo for data fusion with GPS and IMU. The code is a modified version of the "kalman_filter_with_kitti" implementation by Kimura [1]

src/results_a_plotting.py is for filtering and plotting data from the KITTI Benchmark Suite [2]
src/results_b_plotting.py is for filtering and plotting data obtained experimentally using an Arduino-based platform and StrathVoyager ASV.
